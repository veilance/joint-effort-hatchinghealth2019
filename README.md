## About Hatching Health 

The idea is simple; bring brilliant people with different perspectives together to tackle challenges in healthcare. Far too often those facing these challenges are not connected with the expertise and resources to hatch solutions. Together, we can build an agile community of innovators to identify and solve technical problems in healthcare.
